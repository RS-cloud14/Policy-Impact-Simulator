## üåç Overview

The **Policy Impact Simulator** is a data-driven decision-support tool designed to help policymakers, economists, and researchers quantify the economic benefits of policies aimed at retaining senior workers (age 55+) in the workforce.

### The Challenge

Malaysia, like many nations, faces an aging workforce crisis:
- **Workforce participation** for workers 55+ is declining
- **Brain drain** of experienced professionals due to early retirement
- **Economic impact** of losing productive senior workers
- **Pension sustainability** concerns with fewer contributors

### The Solution

This simulator provides:
1. **Real-time economic modeling** of policy interventions
2. **Sector-specific analysis** (Agriculture, Manufacturing, Services)
3. **Multi-dimensional impact assessment** (GDP, tax revenue, EPF, social costs)
4. **AI-powered policy recommendations** via intelligent chatbot
5. **Scenario comparison** (High/Moderate/Low intervention levels)

## üõ† How It Works

### Economic Model

The simulator uses a multi-factor economic model based on official Malaysian government data:

#### 1. GDP Impact Calculation

```
GDP Impact = Workers √ó Productivity Factor √ó Retirement Factor √ó Base Productivity

Where:
- Workers: Number of additional senior workers (55+)
- Productivity Factor: 0.70-0.95 (age-adjusted productivity)
- Retirement Factor: 1 + ((Retirement Age - 60) √ó 0.02)
- Base Productivity: RM 99,265 per worker/year (MITI 2024)
```

**Example:**
- 150,000 workers √ó 0.85 productivity √ó 1.06 retirement factor √ó RM 99,265
- = **RM 13.5 billion** annual GDP impact

#### 2. Employment Rate Impact

```
LFPR Increase = (Additional Workers / Total Labor Force) √ó 100

Total Malaysian Labor Force: 21 million (DOSM 2024)
```

#### 3. Tax Revenue

```
Tax Revenue = Workers √ó Avg Salary √ó Tax Rate

Where:
- Avg Salary: RM 60,000/year
- Tax Rate: 6% (effective average, LHDN)
```

#### 4. EPF Contributions

```
EPF Savings = Workers √ó Avg Salary √ó Total EPF Rate

Where:
- Employee Contribution: 11%
- Employer Contribution: 12%
- Total Rate: 23% (KWSP 2024)
```

#### 5. Social Cost Savings

```
Welfare Reduction = Workers √ó Annual Welfare Per Person

Where:
- Welfare Cost: RM 7,200/person/year (Budget 2025)
```

#### 6. Sector Distribution

**Fixed allocation based on DOSM workforce data:**
- Agriculture: 5%
- Manufacturing: 30%
- Services: 65%

Each sector receives proportional GDP contribution based on total impact.

### Knowledge Retention Score

**Qualitative metric based on:**
```
Score = ((Retirement Age - 60) / 10 √ó 50) + (Productivity √ó 50)

Levels:
- 75+: Very High (optimal mentoring capacity)
- 60-74: High (strong knowledge transfer)
- 45-59: Medium (moderate transfer)
- <45: Low (limited transfer)
```

## üìä Methodology

### Calculation Methodology

All calculations are based on verified data from official Malaysian sources:

#### GDP Impact
- **Base Productivity**: RM 99,265 per worker annually
- **Source**: Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) 2024
- **Assumptions**: 
  - Productivity decreases with age (0.70-0.95 factor)
  - Later retirement increases contribution (2% per year)

#### Tax Revenue
- **Average Salary**: RM 60,000/year
- **Effective Tax Rate**: 6%
- **Source**: Inland Revenue Board Malaysia (LHDN)
- **Note**: Accounts for progressive tax structure

#### EPF Contributions
- **Employee Rate**: 11%
- **Employer Rate**: 12%
- **Total**: 23%
- **Source**: Employees Provident Fund (KWSP) 2024

#### Social Costs
- **Welfare Savings**: RM 7,200 per person/year
- **Source**: Malaysia Budget 2025
- **Includes**: Reduced unemployment benefits, healthcare subsidies

#### Sector Distribution
- **Agriculture**: 5% workforce
- **Manufacturing**: 30% workforce
- **Services**: 65% workforce
- **Source**: Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM)

### Limitations & Assumptions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations:**

1. **Productivity Factor**: Assumes age-related productivity decline; actual varies by sector
2. **Salary Assumptions**: Uses national average; high variance by industry/role
3. **Static Model**: Doesn't account for inflation, economic cycles, or policy feedback loops
4. **Labor Supply**: Assumes sufficient senior workers available and willing
5. **Sector Flexibility**: Real-world sector distribution may differ from model

**Disclaimer**: This tool provides estimates for policy planning. Actual results depend on implementation quality, economic conditions, and specific policy designs.
